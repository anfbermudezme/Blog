# Personal Projects &clubs;

I am A.F Bermúdez, a physics student at the National University of Colombia. I upload my personal projects so that they can be seen by whoever is interested. 

The objective is to show all the projects I have worked on and which have contributed to my academic training.

The platforms that have contributed to my training are Platzi, EDX and Coursera.
